# Big_Data-Spark

This project consists of a dataset containing several million movie ratings collected from the movie recommendation website MovieLens. The ratings were collected over a period of several years starting in January 1995.

I am using a bar chart to show the distribution of the movie ratings, as well as find the movies with the most ratings, and the movies with the highest average rating using RDDs.
